## Dialog at action

### Automatic markdown link (Paste URL)

- [Problem] Existing auto plugins do unnecessary conversions. / Garbled characters occur.

- [Solution] Confirm to user in dialog / anti-garbled japanese website : Êó•Êú¨Ë™û„Ç¶„Çß„Éñ„Çµ„Ç§„Éà„ÅÆÊñáÂ≠óÂåñ„ÅëÂØæÁ≠ñÊ∏à„Åø

- [Usage] Paste URL, then to bring up a dialog. Possible to edit the title.

### Add completed property to DONE task (Mark task as DONE)

- [Problem] Logseq does not record the DONE date.

- [Solution] After the task DONE, add completed property to the block.

- [Usage] After DONE a task, a dialog will appear asking if you want to add a completed property. Possible to edit the date.

- [Result] The date contained in the completed property acts as a link. View completed tasks in Journal Linked References.

## Block context menu (Right click on the bullet)

### `repeat-task as LATER`

- [Problem] Repeat task is for a notification. Not for journaling.

- [Solution] To place in the journal as a LATER task and block reference. For marking "DONE".

- [Usage] A block open into right sidebar. Drag that bullet and place it in the journal. After executing the task, click the repeat-task checkbox first, then the LATER task checkbox.

- [Result] Keep repeat task as a recode in journals.

### `Copy block reference and embed`

- [Problem] no link in embed

- [Solution] insert block reference and embed together

- [Usage] Copy to clipboard

- [Result] Enables access to reference source

### `Make to next line blank`

- [Problem] For blocks with content, line breaks can be annoying.
